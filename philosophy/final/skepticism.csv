What is skepticism?,
Skepticism is the view that we do not or
cannot have knowledge with regards to a
particular domain.

Philosophical skepticism is doubt, not about
some particular piece of knowledge, but about
some entire kind or area of knowledge.;

What is the Cartesian Method of Doubt?,
Descartes’ Method of Doubt
•Doubt anything and everything that is not certain.
• Examine beliefs that are foundational in nature.
• Examine sets of beliefs at a time.
• For any belief about which a skeptical scenario arises,
withhold assent.;
What are the 3 levels of doubt in the first Meditation?,
1. Doubt regarding sensory illusion/error
2. Doubt regarding possible dream
states
3. Doubt regarding deception by an Evil
Demon

Skeptical Argument by Sensory Illusion
(SI1) The senses sometimes deceive us.
(SI2) If something sometimes deceives you, then you
ought never completely trust it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
(SI3) So, you ought never trust the senses completely.

(TDH) You are currently lying down in bed dreaming about sitting
in a lecture hall listening to a lecture.
The Dreaming Argument
(DR1) If you have no way of knowing that TDH is false, then you don’t
know that you’re sitting down in a lecture hall listening to a lecture.
(DR2) You have no way of knowing that TDH is false.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DR3) So, you don’t know that you’re sitting down in a lecture hall
listening to a lecture.

Descartes does not find the fact that his senses sometimes deceive him to result in any particularly severe threat to his knowledge. Why not?,
There are good and bad epistemic circumstances, and we
can generally sort out the difference.
• From the fact that in some circumstances I am subject to
perceptual illusion and error, it does not follow that I have a
reason to doubt my senses in good perceptual
circumstances.;

What skeptical scenario is depicted in the Dreaming Hypothesis (TDH), and how does it (purportedly) undermine our knowledge? Which kind(s) of knowledge are threatened, if TDH is true? What is the Dreaming Argument? Be able to state and explain the argument’s premises and conclusion,

• Knowledge of the External World!
• So, knowledge about anything you perceive with your
senses.
• Memories of such perceptions.
• Your physical body and your experience of it.

The Dreaming Argument (Concise Version)
(DR1) If you can’t know that TDH is false, then you don’t
know that TWH is true.
(DR2) You can’t know that TDH is false.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(DR3) So, you don’t know that TWH is true.;

If we claim that either waking experiences are qualitatively different from dreaming experiences, or that there is a reliable test to distinguish when we are dreaming or not, which premise of the Dreaming Argument are we resisting? Is it effective at showing this premise false? How might the skeptic respond?,;

● Why did Descartes believe that the possibility of an Evil Demon manipulating his thoughts was an even more severe skeptical threat to his knowledge than the possibility that he might be dreaming? How is it worse?,
because it could deny all his knowledge;
● What is a priori knowledge? What is a posteriori knowledge? Give an example of each.,
A priori – something that is knowable completely independent of
experience.
• Triangles have three sides.
• A=A
A posteriori – something that requires experience of the world to come
to know.
• It’s raining.
• There’s a table.
• It’s white.;
● Russell uses inference to the best explanation to say that we can deny the skeptical conclusions. How does this kind of reasoning work? What does Russell take to be the best explanation of our sensory experience, and why? Which premise of the Dreaming Argument is targeted by Russell’s argument?

Common Sense: TWH is the best explanation
(Russell’s use of IBE)
E: Your evidence for believing whatever it is you believe (here,
sense perception)
(TWH) (common sense) The hypothesis that you’re sitting
watching a lecture right now.
(TDH) (skeptical) The hypothesis that you are currently lying
down in bed dreaming about sitting in a lecture hall
listening to a lecture.
Common Sense: Bertrand Russell
2a. Common Sense: TWH is the best explanation
(Russell’s use of IBE)
Russell:
“It may be that the whole outer world is nothing but a dream, and that
we alone exist. This is an uncomfortable possibility; but although it
cannot be strictly proved to be false, there is not the slightest reason
to suppose that it is true.

 Common Sense: TWH is the best explanation
(Russell’s use of IBE)
Russell’s Conclusion:
So, we should believe TWH (that we are sitting watching a
lecture).;

 How might one reject Russell’s response to skepticism?,
 Problems with the IBE response:
• The best explanation might still be bad. (Even false!)
• The simple hypothesis isn’t necessarily true—the truth might be
complicated!
• Does being simple and systematic always make an explanation better?

Worst Problem: it’s inductive
• Showing that TWH is better than TDH by means of IBE at best
demonstrates that TWH is probably true. (Remember, IBE is
inductive.)
• So, at best it can show that TDH is probably false.
• So, it will never satisfy the skeptic, who only needs the possibility
of TDH.

 What is G.E. Moore’s proof of an external world? Does Moore believe that he has proved its conclusion? Its premises? Which premise of the Dreaming Argument is targeted by Moore’s argument?,
1. Here is a hand! *holds up hand*
2. Here is another one! *holds up hand*
3. Therefore, there at least two hands. (from 1 & 2)
4. Therefore, there are at least two objects in the external world.
(from 3)

• A Moorean fact: one of those
things that we know better than
we know the premises of any
philosophical argument to the
contrary.
• If a skeptical scenario causes you
to doubt your basic belief that
you have hands, you ought to
instead doubt that skeptical
scenario.;
● How might a skeptic object to Moore’s proof?,
The Skeptic would take issue with Moore’s rejection
of Premise 1.
• She would argue: Moore, you need to prove my
skeptical scenario false in order to know that you
have hands.
• To just assume it is begging the question!;
