“Similarity”,
Things that are qualitatively identical share a
bunch of properties.;
“Strict” identity,
Things that are quantitatively identical simply are
the same one thing (so, they share absolutely
every single property).;
● What is numerical/quantitative identity (“strict” identity), and how does it differ from qualitative identity (“similarity”)?,
Things are qualitatively identical when they are exactly similar. Identical twins may be qualitatively identical—there may be no telling them apart—but not numerically identical, as there are two of them: that's what makes them twins.;

What kind of identity relation is required for a person to persist through time?,



● What is the soul theory of personal identity? What are some objections to this theory?,
 P1 @ T1 = P2 @ T2 iff P1 and P2 share the same immaterial soul.;

● What is the bodily continuity theory of personal identity? What are some objections to it?,
P1 @ T1 = P2 @ T2 iff P1 and P2 share the same single living physical body

Immortality not possible
 Not consistent with our intuitions that we could have a
different body, or that a mind could exist without a
body.
 Not consistent with our intuition that in brain/body
transplants, it is the brain “donor” who survives.

● How does Gretchen use the example of the Blue River to criticize the soul theory?,
The Blue River
Analogy
What about:
Same body
+
Same psychological traits
=
same soul?
-You know you are seeing
the Blue river because the
water has certain qualities.
-But you’re seeing different
water each time;
● Is “same body, same soul” a reasonable, reliable principle? Why or why not?

● What is John Locke’s view on personal identity? How does the “Prince and the Cobbler” case support his position?,
John Locke & Continuity of
Consciousness
 For Locke, Personal identity
depends on continuity of
consciousness.
 In practice, this means
memory is what makes a
person the same person
she was in the past.;
● What is a person-stage?,
Person-stage: a stretch of
consciousness, such as you
and I are aware of now
A person is a whole
composed of person-stages.;
● What is the memory theory of personal identity? What are some objections to it?,
Locke: the relation between 2 person-stages that makes them
stages of a single person is just that the later one contains
memories of the earlier one.
 P1 @ T1 = P2 @ T2 iff P2 remembers a mental state that that P1
had at T1.

A Problem for Locke...
 Sometimes we can’t remember stuff.
;
Principle of Transitivity of Identity,if x=y, y=z, then x=z;
● What is the memory gap objection to the memory theory of personal identity (also known as the problem of forgetting)? Explain Reid’s counterexample to memory theory involving the young apple thief/victorious captain/senile general (this will require explaining the Principle of Transitivity of identity). Explain how memory theory might be modified to avoid this difficulty.,
-Thomas Reid objects Locke's theory of personal identity (violation of transitivity of identity)

-Transitivity of identity: if x = y, and y = z, then x = z

Example:
Same person a three stages in life: as a boy, as a war officer, and as an old retired general

-Old general remembers being a war officer
-War officer remembers being a boy
-Old general does not remember a boy

Since the old general remembers being an officer, and the officer remembers being a boy, on Locke's memory theory:
general = officer
officer = boy

Now by transitivity of identity:
general = boy

But since the general does not remember being a boy, on Locke's memory theory:
general ≠ boy
Which is a contradiction!!!;

Memory Theory 2.0 (Memory Chain),
Pn @ Tn = P1 @ T1 iff there is a chain (P1, P2, P3, P4,....Pn) such that
each stage in the chain contains at least one memory of
something experienced by the preceding person stage.

A at time T1 is identical to B at some later time T2, only if there is continuity of experience memory between B and A

(reply to Reid's objection)
;
● How does the false memory objection to memory theory arise, and why do attempts to modify memory theory to accommodate this objection involve begging the question?,

Seeming to
remember
Vs.
Actually
remembering

So, we could amend our definition as follows:
Pn @ Tn = P1 @ T1 iff there is a chain (P1, P2, P3, P4,....Pn) such that each stage
in the chain contains at least one memory of something experienced by the
preceding person stage.
…and it only counts as a memory if the rememberer is the same person as
the person who had the experience!
We have just given a circular definition!
(This was pointed out by Bishop Butler);

● What is the idea behind a heavenly duplicate, and why does it pose a problem for memory theory?,
What if he creates two?
Both would appear to be
identical to Gretchen.
But since they are
separate, they cannot be
identical to each other!;

● How can we modify memory theory to avoid the heavenly duplicate problem? Is this a satisfactory modification? What does Gretchen mean by “death by competition”?,
What about a “no competition” clause?,
 So, personal identity amounts to:
continuity of memory + only one rememberer
(at any given time);

● How do soul theory, bodily continuity theory, and memory theory accommodate (or not) the possibility of immortality?
