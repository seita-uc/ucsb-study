What is an argument?,
We mean something like this:
1. All humans are mortal.
2. Socrates is a human.
3. So, Socrates is mortal.;
conclusion indicator,a word like “So,” “Thus,”
or “Therefore.”;
Standard Form,Any argument where the premises occur in a
numbered list, separated from the conclusion by a
line;
What is the role of the premises and of the conclusion?,
 expose the logical structure of the author’s
argument in a way that helps us evaluate it;
What does it mean for an argument to be valid?,
the truth of its premises guarantees the truth of its
conclusion.
In other words, the truth of its conclusion necessarily
follows from the truth of its premises.
It is impossible for a valid argument’s premises to be
true and its conclusion false.

If an argument is valid:
This does NOT mean the premises
are true!
It only means that IF the premises
are true, the conclusion MUST be
true.

Truth is a property of
tatements (premises,
onclusions).
Validity is a property of
whole arguments.
;
To be sound?,
Soundness is a property of
whole arguments.
Soundness = Validity + True Premises!;
What does it mean for an argument to beg the question? Can an argument that begs the question be valid? Be sound?,
 an argument begs the question if one or more of its premises relies for its truth on the truth of the conclusion.

 (P1) Killing innocent people is wrong.
----------------------------------------------------------
(C) Therefore, killing innocent people is wrong.

this is valid and sound;
How do deductive and inductive arguments differ? Give an example of each and explain what makes the argument deductive/inductive (we discussed 3 common forms of inductive arguments),
When an argument is not claimed to be
valid but is intended only to provide a
reason that the conclusion is probably
true, the argument is inductive.

A Deductive argument guarantees the
truth of its conclusion.
An Inductive argument establishes its
conclusion with a high degree of
probability
How do evaluate inductive arguments?,
They are either strong/forceful or weak, depending
upon the strength of the reasons that they provide for
their conclusions.
 When a conclusion is probable given that the premises
are true, that argument is inductively strong, or
inductively forceful.
 Inductive strength comes in degrees.;
Common Forms of Inductive Arguments,
- Statistical
Generalizations
- Inference to the
Best
Explanation
- Arguments from
Analogy;
Statistical Generalizations,
Arguments wherein we sample part of the population to draw a conclusion
about the whole are called statistical generalizations.
Possible problems:
 Is the sample large enough?
 Is the sample biased?
 Is the sampling procedure biased?;
Inference to the Best Explanation,
 Involves the free creation of hypotheses that generate
predictions which can be tested by further observations.
 We find the best explanation by seeing which hypothesis
best “fits” all the available evidence.
 Characteristic of much scientific reasoning.;
 Arguments from Analogy,
 Premises – Two things are similar in some respect(s).
Conclusion – They must also be analogous (similar) in a further respect.

Can Mars support life?
Well, both the earth and Mars have sunlight, water, a solid
body, and gravity. Thus, if the Earth can support life, Mars
probably can as well!
Mars Life (ML)
 (ML1) The Earth can support life.
 (ML2) Both Mars and the Earth have sunlight, water, a solid body,
and gravity.
 (ML4) Probably, Mars can support life
