 What is the “all and only” requirement for constructing good definitions? Be able to provide examples of a definition of something X that fails to meet the “all and only” requirement, and to explain why it fails.


What is a Socratic dialogue, and what is the process of elenchus that characterizes early Socratic dialogues like the Euthyphro?,

Method of elenchus:
• Involves two speakers, a questioner and a respondent (who is usually
a self-described expert).
• Concerns a claim the respondent has made (usually a proposed
definition).
• The questioner asks a series of “yes or no” questions; the respondent
must answer truthfully.
• The respondent is typically unable to defend his proposed answer or
definition. His views are shown to be contradictory or incoherent.

Importance of Definitions
• Definitions – The search for answers to “What is X” questions, which
are treated as searches for precise definitions.
• Socrates is looking for an account that specifies, either:
1. All and Only the things that are X, or
2. The Essence (or Form) of X

Aporia
We are often left in a state of aporia, or perplexity, which is the result
at the end of the Early Socratic dialogues, where a puzzle is raised and
a solution is never found.

What we can learn from them:
• We are drawn into thinking for ourselves about the issues raised.
• We learn to view philosophy as a living and unfinished subject.
• We may be closer to the truth of the matter, having examined for
ourselves some unsatisfactory solutions, and rejected them.;

Socrates and Euthyphro consider the possibility that the holy is what all the gods love. Explain the two ways that this definition might be interpreted.,
Is the pious god-beloved because of
its own nature or just because the
gods love it?;
The Euthyphro Dilemma,
(1) The pious god-beloved because of its own nature, or
(2) Is it pious just because the gods love it?

If (1): There is a standard of piety that is independent of the gods
But we still don’t know what piety is!
If (2): Those things that are pious, are pious, just because the gods
love them. And this makes piety seem arbitrary and at the whim of
the gods.;
Divine Command Theory,
Divine Command Theory is the view that things are
right or wrong because God commands them.

1. We start with a world where nothing is good or bad/right or
wrong.
2. Then God commands, “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife.”
3. Now, by DCT, coveting one’s neighbor’s wife is morally wrong;
How does the Euthyphro dilemma apply to this theory? Explain how both horns of the Euthyphro dilemma lead to an unsatisfying result for DCT.,
If DCT is not true:
• God seems bound by a moral order.
• This is in tension with his being
omnipotent.
• (Or: if God created the moral order,
why did he create it the way he did?)

If DCT is true,
• Not only does morality seem arbitrary,
but without God, moral nihilism seems
to be true.
• That is, nothing is right or wrong, and
nothing has value, outside of God’s
commands.
• Rape, torture, slavery are not bad until
(or unless) God says they are.;
