What does Cultural Relativism claim about the relation of the moral codes of different cultures to what’s right and wrong? For a Cultural relativist, are there any universal moral truths that hold for all peoples at all times?,
1. Different cultures have different moral codes.
- These disagreements are widespread and deep.
- Overall, there is more disagreement than agreement.

2. There is no objective standard that can be used to judge one
societal code better than another.

3. The moral code of our own society has no special status; it
is merely one among many,

4. There is no "universal truth" in ethics, that is, there are no
moral truths that hold for all peoples at all times.

5. The moral code of a society determines what is right and
wrong within that society; that is, if the moral code of a
society says that a certain action is right, then that action is
right within that society

6. It is mere arrogance for us to try to judge the conduct of
other peoples. We should adopt an attitude of tolerance
toward the practices of other cultures. ;
What is the Cultural Differences Argument as presented in Rachels’s article? Is it a good argument? Why or why not?,

Conclusion: Therefore, there is no objective "truth" in morality.
Right and wrong are only matters of opinion, and opinions vary
from culture to culture.
Invalid Argument. Conclusion does not follow from premises.;

For Rachels, what are the three consequences of taking Cultural Relativism seriously? Why does Rachels think these bad for Cultural Relativism?,

1. We could no longer say that the customs of other societies are morally
inferior to our own.

2. We could decide which actions are right or wrong just by consulting
the standards of our society
- This implies we can’t criticize our own culture’s moral code

3. The idea of moral progress is called into doubt
• BUT things do seem to be getting better in some respects (e.g., women’s
suffrage, abolition of slavery)
• Now we can’t make sense of what reformers are even doing.
• Only kind of reform is bringing things into line with existing ideals;

Both Rachels and Nussbaum examine the practice of FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) as a case that is problematic for Cultural Relativism. In general terms, what is FGM, and why might it be a problem for Cultural Relativism?,

non-medical reasons

Is it OK to criticize cultures that endorse FGM?
• To encourage those cultures to change their practices? To contribute to
change?
Cultural Relativism says: NO;
