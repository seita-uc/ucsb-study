What is consequentialism, as opposed to nonconsequentialism?,
According to consequentialism, the morality of an action depends solely
on the consequences it brings about.

According to nonconsequentialism, the morality of an action does not
depend solely on its consequences.
• Never depends on consequences, or
• Depends on consequences plus some other factor(s) (e.g., duty, rights, virtue,
motive/intention);
For Utilitarianism, what is intrinsically good and what is intrinsically bad? For a Utilitarian deciding which action to take, whose utility/disutility counts, and how much does it count?,

What is intrinsically good?
• Utility = pleasure or happiness
• All other things can be good only extrinsically, i.e., only insofar as they
promote utility… e.g., money, courage, friendship
What is intrinsically bad?
• Disutility = pain or unhappiness

What is utility? Utility = pleasure or happiness
• Bentham: pleasures differ only in duration and intensity
• Mill: distinguished higher and lower pleasures
• Higher pleasures engage our uniquely human capacity for higher forms of rationality.

Whose Utility matters?
• Everyone/everything that can experience pleasure/happiness.
How much does each being matter?
• Comparable pleasures count equally regardless of who or what experiences them.
• Persons (and sentient beings) are –in this way –given equal consideration
• The theory promotes impartiality i.e. you cannot give more weight to yours or your
friends’ pleasure/pain than to the pleasure/pain of strangers or enemies.;

What is Act Utilitarianism’s (AU) principle of right action?,
“Act-Utilitarianism” (AU):
“An action is morally right [obligatory] if, and only if, of those actions
available to the agent in the circumstances, it would produce the greatest
total net happiness.” Otherwise it is wrong. [Stephen Darwall];

Is there ever a case where one or more actions are optional for an Act Utilitarian? If so, what kind of case is this? Is there ever a case where an action is supererogatory?,
An action is optional only if there is a tie between it and some other
actions that maximize utility.);

What are some attractive features of Act Utilitarianism as an ethical theory?,
(1) Equal Moral Worth
(2)Pleasure/Happiness as intrinsically valuable
(3)Increasing Happiness/Decreasing Pain in the World
(4)Parsimonious (Simple) and Principled
(5)Independent;
State and explain the objection that hedonism paints a degrading picture of humanity. How does Mill address this objection? Is his response successful?,

It paints a degrading picture of
humanity.
It’s a philosophy for pigs!

Higher pleasures involve the engagement of higher faculties associated with
(distinctly human) rationality
• How do we know these are to be preferred to lower pleasures?
• Those who are well acquainted with both would judge that higher pleasures
are better.;

State and explain the objection that AU is too demanding.,
Act Utilitarianism demands we always be making complex moral calculations.
• It’s an exhausting way to live.
• We’re very likely wrong about it. A lot.

State and explain the objection that AU leads the actor to violate individual rights.,
Organ Harvesting Case
Should a doctor kill an innocent,
healthy person and harvest his organs
to save five others?
• AU says: Kill him and harvest his
organs!
• Conflicts with our intuitions about
rights.;
What is Rule Utilitarianism (RU)? Name an objection to AU that RU purportedly solves and explain how it does so using an example.,

Rule Utilitarianism: The right act is the act in accordance with the
right rule,
and
The right rule is the rule that, if followed by
most people most of the time, would
maximize net utility (relative to other possible
rules).

Individual Rights are important (Organ Harvesting case, possibly
justifies bad practices, e.g., slavery, genocide)

Objections from
Individual Rights
 Objection: AU is Too Demanding

Rules could be made to forbid the kinds of harms that violate rights.
Rules provide a handy decision procedure that simplifies day-to-day
moral choices for the Utilitarian.;

What is the Consistency Objection to Rule Utilitarianism? Illustrate with an example (it can be the one we used in class).,
Given hedonism, and given the idea that
the purpose of ethics is to maximize
utility, there is no reason to stick to our
moral rules in cases where we know
that doing so will not increase utility
(relative to the other options)

The right rule: Don’t break promises!
• You and a friend are stranded on a desert island.
Your friend is dying. To comfort her, you
promise to plant a garden over her grave. She
dies.
• Should you keep your promise, even though it
will cause you great suffering to do so (and she’s
no longer around to be affected)?
• RU says: YES! AU says: NO!;
