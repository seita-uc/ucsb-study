Describe the case of Fred and his puppies. What is Norcross comparing this case to, and what argument does he give?

Fred lost his natural ability to
secrete cocoamone, the chemical
that enables humans to enjoy
chocolate.
• The only way he can get
cocoamone is by torturing and
killing puppies.
• Fred does this repeatedly.

The Fred's Puppies Argument
1. If it’s wrong to torture puppies for gustatory pleasure, then
it’s wrong to support factory farming.
2. It is wrong to torture puppies for gustatory pleasure.
3. Therefore, it’s wrong to support factory farming

1. Factory farms are torturous for the animals in them
2. There is no significant difference between factory farmed animals and
puppies
3. There is no difference between torturing and supporting torturous activity;

One might claim that whether one person either does or doesn’t buy factory farmed meat will not have any effect on the industry of factory farming. So why should an individual refrain from buying it?,
But… my support makes no difference!
The Problem of Causal Impotence: It is very unlikely that any one
individual’s refraining from eating meat will have any measurable effect
on the welfare of factory farmed animals.
▪Reply 1: Participation in a collective harm can make one morally complicit.
▪Reply 2: By refraining from meat, you contribute to a solution (tipping point?)
▪Reply 3: By refraining from meat, you may encourage others to refrain as well.;
What is the Texan’s Challenge, and what does it say about the morality of our treatment of animals?,

The Texan’s Challenge
1. If it’s wrong to torture puppies for gustatory pleasure, then it’s
wrong to support factory farming.
2. It is NOT wrong to support factory farming.
3. Therefore, it’s NOT wrong to torture puppies for gustatory pleasure.;

What is the Rationality Gambit, and how does it purport to justify the differential treatment of humans and non-human animals?

Humans have a superior ethical status to animals, such that our interests
carry greater weight than those of animals.
This is because we are rational, and they are not.
In particular, humans have the ability to engage in moral reasoning

If rationality is a morally significant difference, then we have reason to care
less about animal interests;

What is the Marginal Cases Challenge, and how does it threaten the use of rationality as a criterion for the preferential treatment of human interests?,

The Challenge of Marginal Cases
• The Marginal Cases Challenge: “Whatever kind and level of rationality is
selected as justifying the attribution of superior moral status to humans will
either be lacking in some humans or present in some animals.” (214)
• We will assume that the criterion of rationality is an ability to engage in
moral reflection.

What are the Type Defense and the Bullet Biting defense against the Marginal Cases Challenge? Do either of them work? Why or why not?,
1. Type Defense: Humans are a type of things that are generally rational, so
even if particular humans are non-rational, they still have higher moral status.
• But what if we (say, using Cat Serum) transform a creature of the wrong type (a cat) into a
rational agent capable of moral reasoning? It would seem to be wrong to kill it.
2. Bullet-Biting Defense: Non-rational humans actually don’t have higher
moral status than non-human animals. But for practical/emotional reasons, we
shouldn’t torture, kill, or otherwise mistreat them.
• But something as variable as human sentiments cannot ground stable differential
treatment, either in the case of puppies, or in the case of people.;

What’s the difference between a moral agent and a moral patient, and what does Norcross think should be considered when judging whether something is a moral patient?,

A moral agent is a being who:
• can be moved by moral reasons, claims, or arguments, and
• is subject to moral obligation and evaluation.
• Rationality is morally relevant in determining who has moral agency.
A moral patient is a being who is a proper object of moral concern.
• To be a moral patient, it is not necessary to be a moral agent;
