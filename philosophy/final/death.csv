● What does Feldman mean when he says that he will offer a “biological concept of death” --in what sense is it biological? Does he intend to provide a definition or a criterion of death? (Be sure to explain the difference between those options.),
“As I see it, just as there is a single concept of life that
applies to every living plant and animal, so there is a
single concept of death that potentially applies to every
organism from the lowliest plant all the way up to the
most complex mammal.” (165)
 The biological concept of death

For practical matters, we might need to employ a
criterion that determines whether a person is dead
 This should be an easy-to-apply standard.
 A criterion hopes to identify some condition that will pick out
all/only cases of deaths.
 But a criterion does not purport to express a conceptual
truth.

;
● What counterexample does Feldman use against Roy Perrett’s definition that death is the destruction/annihilation/disintegration of an organism?,
But destruction, annihilation, and disintegration are all
different processes.
 And the case of the butterfly specimen in a jar
provides a counterexample to each of these 3
analyses;

● State one of Feldman’s definitions of death. What problem is posed for this definition? How does Feldman resolve this difficulty in the next definition?;
A Problem for D1: Suspended Animation
 In these sorts of cases, there is cessation of life, only for
that life to return.
 The (first) cessation of life is not permanent, and that’s
the point.
 Suspended animation is a temporary cessation of life.
The Standard Analysis of Death
D2: x dies at t =df x ceases permanently to be
alive at t.
 This fixes our initial problem with cases of
Suspended Animation.;

● Feldman suggests three possible ways that a being/entity might go out of existence without dying. What are they? (Give examples),
Metamorphosis: When a caterpillar turns
into a butterfly, the
caterpillar ceases to exist
but doesn’t die.”

Fission-like Cases:Put a healthy organism into a cell
separator
 All of the cells are preserved alive,
but they no longer make up the
organism.; 

Fusion: The chlamydomona are a
type of single-celled green
algae that engage in a sort of
fusion.
 According to D6, the
chlamydomona dies at the
moment of fusion;

What is hedonism? State and explain Epicurus’ argument that death is not bad for us and note why hedonism is important to the argument.,
Hedonism: Pleasure as intrinsically good, pain
as intrinsically bad.

1. Death involves neither pleasure nor pain.
2. The only thing bad for us is pain.
3. If something does not involve pain, it
cannot be bad for us.
--------------------------------------------------------------
4. Therefore, death is not bad for us.
;

● State and explain Epicurus’ argument that there is no time at which death can harm us.,
Time of Harm Argument
1. If death harms the individual that dies, it could do so
either while they are alive or after they are alive.
2. Death cannot harm someone after they are alive/have
died.
3. Death cannot harm someone while they are alive/
before they have died.
4. Therefore, death cannot harm one at all. Death is
nothing to us!;

● Brueckner & Fischer argue that death can be bad for someone even when it is regarded as an experiential blank. Explain what this means. What is another example they mention of a thing that is bad for us without being experienced as bad?
Things that are bad
1. Things that are experienced as bad.
Pain
2. Things that are not experienced as
bad.
Death, A friend’s betrayal;
● Explain the deprivation account of the badness of death. What is Lucretius’ objection to this theory?,
Death is bad because it deprives us of goods.
A Problem:
 Why don’t we care about the goods we would have had if
only we had been born earlier?

Lucretius’ Symmetry Argument
1. Death is relevantly similar to prenatal nonexistence in
that both deprive us of goods we would have if we
were alive instead.
2. We are indifferent toward our prenatal nonexistence.
3. Therefore, we ought to be indifferent toward our death,
too.
;
● We discussed 4 ways to respond to Lucretius’ symmetry argument: 3 that Brueckner and Fischer examined and found inadequate, and Brueckner and Fischer’s own response. Present and explain one of these three responses that B&F found inadequate. Explain what this response leaves to be desired.,
Nagel: the logical impossibility of being born earlier
Parfit: different attitudes toward past vs. future suffering
Deprivation of goods we’ve already had

Nagel’s Solution: Necessary vs. Contingent
1. It is logically impossible for the same person to be born
earlier, but it is possible for that person to live longer.
2. It is irrational (or even impossible) to regret something
that is necessarily true.
3. So, it is reasonable to be indifferent toward prenatal
nonexistence (necessary property of you) while still
fearing death (contingent property of you).
Problem: It’s controversial that your birth date is a
necessary property!

Parfit: Past vs. Future Bads
1. “There are cases where we are indifferent toward...our
own past suffering, but not indifferent toward our own
future suffering.”
2. So, it’s not irrational to have different attitudes toward
comparable past and future bads.
3. So, it isn’t irrational to have asymmetric attitudes toward
prenatal vs. postmortem nonexistence (where these
periods of non-existence are taken to be bads)
Problem:

This example is of a bad experienced as
bad—unlike death!

Deprivation of goods we’ve
already had
1. Prenatal nonexistence: not a deprivation of goods
already had.
2. Death: the good stuff has been taken away!
Problem:
 The badness of this kind of deprivation seems to depend
on the frustration of being deprived of a thing one
previously enjoyed. ;


● How do Brueckner & Fischer defend the rationality of our asymmetrical attitudes toward prenatal versus postmortem nonexistence?,
B&F: Attitudes toward past and
future goods
 We prefer our goods in the future (at least the ones we
experience as such), and that’s why we long to not die
earlier in a way we don’t long to have been born earlier.
 Good experiences are preferable to the experiential
blank of death
 “The alternative to death is good experiences,
whereas… the alternative to a future betrayal behind
one’s back is not good experiences.;
