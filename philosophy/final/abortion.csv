● Moral vs. Legal: What are some examples of immoral, legal actions and moral, illegal actions?,
Prostitution
Killing enemy soldiers in a war?
Pirating content that has been abandoned and can't even be purchased any more.

Eg an out of print book, or a game that isn't sold any more;

● What is the difference between a human and a person? Provide examples of a case where a human is not a person, and vice versa.,
• To be a human is to have human DNA, to belong to the species of homo
sapiens,
To be a person is to be a member of the moral community,;

● Why does Thomson propose that the fetus be considered a person from the moment of conception?,

Thomson: Let’s Grant that Fetuses are Persons
1. The development of a human being from conception through birth into
childhood is continuous.
2. To draw a line and say “personhood begins here” seems arbitrary.
3. Therefore, let’s just grant that the fetus is a person from the moment of
conception.
Since all persons have a right to life, the fetus has a right to life.
• Even so, there are still cases where abortion is morally permissible!;

● What is The Extreme (conservative) View on the permissibility of abortion? How is this position supported?,
Extreme View (Conservative): abortion is never morally permissible.
it means killing innocent human;
;
● What does it mean for an action to be supererogatory? Give an example of such an action.,

The action is not obligatory, but it taking it would be better
than not taking it. (The action is “above and beyond” the call of moral duty.)

donating money;

● Explain the thought experiment in which you wake up medically attached to an ailing violinist. What does Thomson intend this case to show?,


1. It is morally permissible to unplug from the
violinist.
2. If it is morally permissible to unplug from
the violinist, then it is morally permissible
for a woman to have an abortion when the
pregnancy is the result of rape.
3. Therefore, it is morally permissible for a
woman to have an abortion when the
pregnancy is the result of rape.;

● Explain the thought experiment in which a child is growing rapidly inside a tiny house. What does Thomson intend this case to show?,
Tiny House /
Rapidly Growing Child Casea,

Abortion Cases:
Where Pregnancy Threatens Life of Mother

You’re trapped in a tiny house with a rapidly growing child.
- If the child doesn’t stop growing, you’ll be crushed.
- The only way to stop its growing is to kill it.
“However innocent the child may be, you do not have to wait
passively while it crushes you to death.”

This is a case of self-defense.;

● Explain the thought experiment in which person-plants might grow in your carpet. What does Thomson intend this case to show?,
What about Consensual Sex + Contraception?

People Seeds

What if it were not
burglars, but innocent
people seeds that floated
in through the open
windows?
Do you have a right to remove
a seed if it takes root?

It is morally permissible to uproot the person-plant growing in your carpet.
2. If it is morally permissible to uproot the person-plant, then it is morally
permissible for a woman to have an abortion in cases where she had
consensual sex but attempted to prevent the pregnancy by using
contraception.
3. Therefore, it is morally permissible for a woman to have an abortion in
cases where she attempted to prevent the pregnancy by using
contraception.;

● Thomson suggests that the right to life does not entail the right to the bare minimum that one needs to survive. Give an example she uses to support this claim and explain how it provides this support.,
The Cool Hand of “The Rock”

Say Thomson is dying of fever.
• The only thing that will cure her is the touch of
the The Rock’s cool hand on her fevered brow.
• She does not have a right to it!;

● Don Marquis proposes that pro-life principles regarding the wrongness of killing (those focusing on the sanctity of human life) are often too broad in scope, while the corresponding pro-choice principles (those focusing on personhood) are too narrow. Explain this difference with examples.,

Pro-Life Account: (Sanctity of Human Life)
• Killing normal adult humans is bad because taking a human life is bad.
• Too broad: includes human cancer cells

Pro-Choice Account: (Personhood)
• Killing normal adult humans is bad because killing persons is bad.
• Too narrow: excludes infants, small children, the temporarily unconscious, etc.;

● What is Marquis’ theory as to what makes killing normal adult humans wrong? How does he use this theory to argue that abortion is impermissible?,

The Future-Like-Ours(FLO) Account
Why is it wrong to kill us?
• “What makes killing any adult human being prima facie seriously wrong is the
loss of his or her future”
• Such a future is valuable because it includes the goods of consciousness:
the experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments that make up a normal
human life.
• If this is true, then it’s prima facie seriously morally wrong to kill anything (or
anyone) that has a Future Like Ours (FLO).;

● According to Marquis, what kinds of things does his FLO account explain well? Among other things, this may include cases that the personhood or sanctity-of-human-life accounts have a hard time explaining well.,

It explains:
1. Why killing is one of the worst crimes.
2. The Considered Judgment of the Dying
3. Certain kinds of Cases:
• Badness of killing Non-human animals
• Badness of killing Aliens with a FLO / undiscovered species
• Active Euthanasia is not (always) wrong
• Badness of killing Children & Infants;
● What is the “desire account” of the wrongness of killing, and why does Marquis find it inadequate?,
Desire Account: Killing is wrong because it interferes with the fulfillment of the desire to live.
- Still seems wrong to kill those in a coma, or who are suicidally depressed;
● Explain the cat serum counterexample that Tooley proposes for the idea that it is seriously wrong to kill any being with a FLO. How does this pose a problem for Marquis’s account?,

Would it be
permissible to
administer an
antidote at any time
before the cat
transforms, keeping it
a normal cat (but
taking away its FLO?);

Objections to the FLO Account,
1. Killing very old people isn’t (so) bad?
2. Cat Serum / Cow Machine Cases
3. FLO account entails that contraception is immoral
4. Does not address Thomson’s Account?;
● Explain why contraception that prevents implantation of the fertilized egg (e.g., the birth control pill, IUDs, the morning after pill) are immoral under the FLO account. Does this present a problem for Marquis’s account of the wrongness of killing? Why or why not?,
However, Marquis’ theory judges killing to be a harm if it deprives a being of a FLO, not if
it prevents a being with a FLO from coming into existence. (Korman);

● Why might it be less wrong to kill very old people under Marquis’s account of the wrongness of killing,
