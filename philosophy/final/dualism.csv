What does Descartes mean by “Cogito, ergo sum,” and how does he arrive at that conclusion?,
I AM, I EXIST
• The proposition cannot be doubted because it is incorrigible.
• Self-warranting, self-confirming, self-evident
• Merely considering it guarantees that it is true.
• Even in the act of doubting it, we confirm it: “I doubt I am” “I
am deceived”;
Leibniz’s Law,The indiscernibility of identicals:
• For any x and y, if x is identical to y, then x and y have all the same
properties.;
How does Descartes use it to argue for his version of mind-body dualism?,
How do I know body and mind are different things?
1. I can doubt the existence of my body.
2. I cannot doubt the existence of my mind, a thinking thing.
3. If my body and mind are the same thing, then they have all the same
properties. (by Leibniz’s Law)
4. My body has a property that my mind does not: the property that I
am able to doubt its existence.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Therefore, my mind and body are distinct.;
● What is substance dualism?,
Substance dualism, on the other hand, is the view that there exist in the universe two fundamentally different kinds of substance: physical (matter) and non-physical (mind or consciousness), and subsequently also two kinds of properties which adhere in those respective substances. ;
● What is property dualism?,
Property dualism describes a category of positions in the philosophy of mind which hold that, although the world is composed of just one kind of substance—the physical kind—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: physical properties and mental properties. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in or supervene upon certain physical substances (namely brains).;
