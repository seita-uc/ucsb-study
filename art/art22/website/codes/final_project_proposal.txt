My final project will be a visualization of power relations between languages around the world. I will use the wikipedia api to retrieve the data of which language is often used in the internet sphere. Using the data from this api with websocket will enable the visualization to change in real-time according to the data flow of wikipedia and it will be a good material for every language user to understand how each langauge has different influence in the world.
