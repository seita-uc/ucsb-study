Core, research that tries to explain "basic" processes
– thought to be "purely linguistic";
Periphery, research that explores the ramifications of
those processes
– often investigating connections between language and
other domains of cognition
● sensory perception
● social interaction
● culture;
Linguistic relativity, aka linguistic determinism
This is the idea that the language someone speaks influences
"how they think"
– sometimes "influences" is called "weak" version of the hypothesis
– "determines" is strong version

● Whorf emphasized the "strong" version of the hypothesis
– languages constrain thinking in ways that speakers cannot
escape
– different languages inexorably force their speakers to have
totally different worldviews;
Design features of languages,
- semanticity
– arbitrariness
– discreteness
– displacement
– duality of patterning
– productivity (or generativity)

There are questions about how universal these features really are
– Hockett proposed some additional ones, such as "vocal communication
channel" which clearly are not universal (as shown by sign languages)
● However, they're useful to think about from a cognitive
perspective because they are pretty good at distinguishing
language from animal communication
– they draw our attention to what cognitive apparatus humans may have
that other animals don't
● They also can distinguish language from other kinds of human
communication (e.g., pantomime, drawing);
Semanticity,Language conveys meaning
– individual bits of language convey individual bits of
meaning
● This already is quite different from most forms
of animal communication
– in many cases, an entire "act" of animal
communication communicates an entire message
– e.g., warning cry;
Arbitrariness, The relationship between linguistic form and meaning is
largely arbitrary
– there is no inherent similarity between the word "dog" and an actual
dog
– this is why different languages can have different words for the
same thing
● This is in contrast to many kinds of animal communication
– e.g., mating displays that signal strength/fitness
● As we will see, however, there is evidence of non-arbitrary
dimensions in language;
Discreteness,Each "piece" of language (e.g., each sound, each word) is distinct from each
other
– we have, e.g., [b] and [p] but not "something halfway between"
– (another language may have another sound that could be described as "between"
these, but if so, then in that language it is its own thing)
● Variation between speakers, conditions, etc. is still filtered into categorical
judgements
– if someone mumbles, jet plane taking off in background, etc., you do not interpret
it as something between a [b] and a [p]
● This is again in contrast to animal communication
– e.g., growls
– also in contrast to nonlinguistic human vocalizations (e.g., groans);
Displacement,Language can refer to things/events/situations that are
displaced in space and time
● We can talk about yesterday, tomorrow, the 13th century
BC, South Hall, Tristan da Cunha, etc.
● It is unclear if any other animals are fully capable of this
● Some have argued that some human languages (e.g.,
Pirahã) do not do this
– but difficult to distinguish between inability of language to do
so and unwillingness of speakers to do so;
Duality of patterning,
Languages uses small "meaningless" units to create larger
"meaningful" units
– phonemes combine into morphemes
– morphemes combine into words, etc.
● This two-stage structure is a key component of the complexity of
language relative to other communication systems
– humans appear to have no problem with this, but animal communication
systems do not approach it
● There is a large difference between human communication that
does not use this (e.g., pantomime) and human communication
that does use this (e.g., sign languages);
Productivity,Although number of morphemes is (mostly) fixed, number of messages is
(theoretically) infinite
– we never "run out" of possible messages
● Among the design features this one is more contentious
– Although the number of messages is theoretically infinite, evidence shows that in
practice there is a lot of re-use of already-used messages
– some claims that Pirahã has such a restrictive grammar that it would actually
only allow a finite number of utterances
● Nonetheless, the productive capacity of human language appears to
significantly exceed that of most or all animal communication systems
– many animal communication systems have relatively small and fixed number of
possible messages;
Functional features of language,
Although not part of Hockett's list, interesting to mention
● Features that all languages appear to have because of their
(apparently) universal functional relevance
● Two prominent examples:
– questions (anything that can be asserted can be questioned)
– negation (anything that can be asserted can be negated)
● Although extremely simple to state, these characteristics of
language radically differentiate it from animal
communication;
Modularity,Mental modularity is the notion that different
kinds of cognition exist as separate "modules"
– domain-specific (focuses on just one type of task)
– distinct neural structure (special brain parts)
– encapsulated (limited communication to or from
other cognition);
Language origins,
Continuity hypothesis proposes that language
developed gradually from simpler
communication systems
– and preexisting cognitive abilities
● Discontinuity hypothesis proposes that
language is a "quantum leap" ability

Some design features are easier to explain in a
continuity perspective than others
– arbitrariness is imaginable as a process of gradual
analogy (e.g., sound meaning "lion" "big animal" →
→ "animal" may leave little relationship between
word and original referent)

A modular view of language is obviously more
compatible with discontinuity hypothesis
– language being structurally separate from other cognition is
consistent with it appearing separately
● Continuity hypothesis pushes us toward thinking about
relationship of language to other human characteristics
– social behavior
– cooperation
– tool use;
– duality of patterning is a bit trickier to explain
