Prototypes,
● These findings are inconsistent with a traditional
"checklist" view of meanings
– if being a "sport" was an all-or-nothing matter, there should
be no difference in deciding whether basketball, curling,
bocce, League of Legends, etc., are examples of a sport
● The members of a category have a "family resemblance"
– each member has some similarity to other members
– some members are similar to many other members
● But there is no definitive list of criteria for membership;

● Prototypes are sometimes described as categories with "fuzzy"
boundaries
– there may be a gray area between things that are definitely sports
and things that are definitely not
● However, prototype effects have been found even for
categories whose membership is unambiguous
– 3 is a more prototypical odd number than 3159
● So prototypes are more than just fuzzy categories
– they seem to represent something fuzzy in the way we cognitively
access or conceptualize the categories;
Simulation semantics,
● This theory of meaning is called simulation semantics
or embodied semantics
– it posits that using and understanding language involves
sensorimotor systems to "simulate" the experience of
perceiving and/or interacting with the real world
● This is a strongly non-modular view
– it suggests that sensory perception, motor control, and
language processing are inextricably linked;
Facilitation or interference,
● This could happen for two reasons
– seeing same color helps make the decision
– seeing different color interferes with decision
● They did two other versions where color was desaturated
(barely noticeable)
– no more difference between the cases
– reaction times on mismatch speeded up
● Conclusion: it's not so much same color facilitating as
different color interfering ;
