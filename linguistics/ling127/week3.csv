Mental Lexicon,
The mental lexicon is our term for a speaker's "list" of words they
know
– or morphemes they know. . .
● We assume that speakers have certain knowledge about each
word
– sounds (phonology)
– meaning (semantics)
– subcomponents (morphology)
● Psycholinguistic studies on words try to figure out the structure
of this mental lexicon (how it is organized);
Lexical decision,
● A huge amount of word research has used the lexical decision task
– participant sees or hears a word or nonword
– has to push button as quickly as possible to say whether it's a word
or not
● Mostly, what we look at is the reaction times
– we try to see what makes people faster at identifying a word as a real
word
● There are some variations
– e.g., participants hear a word mixed with "white noise" and have to
identify the word;
Priming in lexical decision,
● In other words. . . priming!
● There have been a lot of studies about "what can you see/hear
before a word that will make you recognize the word faster"
● Answer. . . lots of things
● Priming effects have been reported for. . .
– words that share sounds with the target
– words that share meaning with the target
– words that are associated with the target
– pictures of things associated with the target
– etc;
Word priming methodology,
● There are certain factors that people have tried to vary in priming
studies to see if they affect the results
● stimulus onset asynchrony
– length of time between prime and target
– the longer it is, the more likely that people engaged conscious mechanisms
● relatedness proportion
– proportion of trials where words are related
– if many trials have relatedness, people may notice that and start to use
more conscious strategy
– "I get it, some of these are related"

● Of course, relatedness proportion assumes not all are related!
● In priming studies (and pretty much any studies) people usually
include fillers
– trials that are similar to the real (or "critical") trials, but which don't
actually test what you're trying to test
● Fillers serve (at least) two purposes
– "clear the mind" of the participant to minimize priming across trials
● you see the prime, you see the target. . . but you're still primed for the next one too
– obfuscate the purpose of the experiment to reduce conscious strategizing
● e.g., you notice the words share sounds and start paying attention to the sounds;
Semantic Priming,
 The earliest priming studies (e.g., Meyer and
Schvaneveldt 1971) looked at semantic priming
– people saw two words
– had to say whether they were both words or not
– sometimes words were related (e.g., BREAD-BUTTER and
NURSE-DOCTOR), sometimes not (BREAD-DOCTOR,
NURSE-BUTTER)
– some words were nonwords (e.g., MARB)
– people were faster to respond when words were related;
Relatedness,
● A big question in semantic priming concerns the relative
influence of feature overlap and assocation
● Things can be "related" in two ways
● they can be similar to each other (feature overlap)
– table, bed
– leaf, feather
● Or they can be associated with eacher other (association)
– bed, pillow
– bird, feather

● These two kinds of relatedness have given rise to different conceptions of
how word meanings are stored in the mind
– sometimes termed holistic and distributed
– or network vs feature-space
● Holistic model assumes each concept is essentially a unitary "thing" in the
mind
– relationships between concepts are due to associations between them
– e.g., we have one "chunk" in our mind for dog, another for cat
– activation "spreads" from one concept to another
– "The more properties (i.e., features) two concepts (e.g.,CHERRY and APPLE) have
in common, the more connections exist between the two nodes via these
properties" (Hutchison 2003)

;
Holistic vs distributed,
● "As might be imagined, testing between these models is extremely
difficult" (Hutchison)
● One obvious problem is that many things that share features are
associated, and vice versa
– dog and cat share features "mammal", "four legs", "fur", "pet", "medium
size", etc.
– they are also associated because we encounter them in similar situations,
they have similar functional roles (e.g., "you go to the store to buy food
for them")
● Kind of "duh" that things that are similar would be associated in
many contexts. . .

● Similarly it can be difficult to distinguish
between "these concepts have this feature in
common" and "these concepts are associated
because they both neighbor this third concept"
– e.g., do dog and cat share feature "pet", or are they
both linked to a third concept pet?
– how would we distinguish these possibilities?
;
Morphological priming,
● In Marslen-Wilson et al.'s study, the prime was given auditorily (but target was
given visually)
● They interpreted their findings in terms of ambiguity resolution
● If you hear reac, you are "ready" to hear reaction or reactive
– but once you choose one, you discard the other
● Whereas if you hear dis- you cannot discard candidates because you haven't
decided yet
– prefixes and suffixes have different informational value
● "This pattern of results leads to a model of lexical structure where semantically
transparent, morphologically complex words are represented, at the level of the
lexical entry, in decomposed morphemic form"
– in other words, we store morphemes separately if they contribute separately to the meaning;
