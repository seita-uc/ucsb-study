Simple (or basic) clauses,A simple clause contains only one clause.
• A clause contains one predicate.
• A predicate expresses an ‘event’ in a sentence;
events may be actions, processes, situations,
states, so on.
• In English, verbs and verb phrases typically fulfill the
predicate role.
• A complex clause contains a main clause and a
dependent clause.;
Adding more complexity to clauses,As children acquire more constructions that they hear
from adult input, they add more complexity to their
language production
• However, hearing adult input does not suffice,
because children have to process and understand it
• Their general cognitive mechanisms — pattern-finding
remembering, and categorizing — are still developing;
Multi-modal negation,Multi-modal communication refers to use of actions, gestures, and
spoken words as different modalities of expressions
• Note: Use of gesture and signed words does not equate multimodal communication, because both occur in the same modality!
• Some child language researchers take a multi-modal approach to
studying language development
• Here, multi-modal negation refers to use of actions, gestures, and
spoken words for a variety of negative functions;
Questions,• There are two general types of questions: polar and interrogative
• Polar questions expect the answer yes or no
1. Do you want a cookie?
2. Can I have a cookie?
• Interrogative questions expect content answers
3. What’s that?
4. Where is Coconut going?
5. Who broke the vase?
6. Why does Coconut sleep all day?
• Both question types require an inversion of the subject and the
auxiliary verb;
Polar questions,Children generally produce one common error for
forming polar questions
• Omission of auxiliary markers (BE, DO, CAN, WILL)
and the copula marker BE
• Mommy want eggnog?
• I ride train?
• They produce affirmative constructions with an
external question marker (as indicated by rising
intonation);
Errors in children’s questions,
• Children produce two error types for forming
interrogatives
1. Omission of auxiliary markers (BE, DO, CAN, WILL)
and the copula marker BE
2. Commission: using the wrong order of linguistic
elements or using the wrong elements;
Omission of auxiliary markers (BE, DO, CAN, WILL)
and the copula marker BE,
• where you going? instead of where are you going?
• what we do with this thing? instead of what {do,
can, will} we do with this thing?
Remember: There are two verbs do. One is a main verb
meaning “accomplish something” or “perform an
action.” The other is a so-called dummy auxiliary;
Commission errors,
a. Subject-auxiliary non-inversion (SAI)
• what she can eat? instead of what can she eat?
• what she doesn’t like? instead of what doesn’t
she like?
b. Double auxiliary markers
• what can he can do? instead of what can he do?
• what does she doesn’t like? instead of what
doesn’t she like?
c. Double tense markers
• what does he likes? instead of what does he like?
• oh, did I caught it? instead of oh, did I catch it?
d. Case errors
• where can me go? instead of where can I go?
e. No subject-auxiliary agreement
• where does the boys go? instead of where do the
boys go?;
Complex constructions,
Complex constructions are traditionally divided into
two types:
1. Coordinate clauses: Two or more clauses that are
functionally equivalent or symmetrical
2. Subordinate clauses: Two or more clauses that have
an asymmetrical relationship,
Coordination,One way to combine basic, independent clauses into
a complex clause is to link them by coordination
(making coordinate clauses).
(a) Lina arrived early
(b) Savi was half an hour late
(c) Corrine didn’t even show up
(d) Lina arrived early and Savi was half an hour late
but Corrine didn’t even show up
• What is the fundamental difference between examples
(a-c) and (d)?
Children use and for marking coordinate clauses more than
any other conjunction.
• Order of acquisition of and: additive < temporal < causal
;
Complex constructions,
• A complex construction contains two clauses:
• a main clause (also known as a matrix clause)
• a subordinate or dependent clause
• The subordinate clause may be “embedded” in the
main clause or may follow the main clause
There are different types of subordinate clauses:
• Complement clauses
• Relative clauses
;
Complement clauses,
• Complement clauses represent speaker attitudes —
some belief or commitment to a statement
• Verbs like want, have to, know, think, wish, hope,
etc. express different attitudes
• They are either finite clauses with inflected verbs or
non-finite clauses with infinitive verbs
• Complementizers such as that and wh-words are
optional in English
• A finite clause with an inflected verb
(a) I thought (that) they would be early
• A non-finite clause with an infinite verb (uninflected)
(b) I want to study hard for my exam
(c) I wanted them to study hard for their exam
;
Relative clauses,Relative clauses are subordinate clauses that modify a
referential expression in the main clause. Here are a
couple textbook examples:
(a) The professor [who is very tall] comes from Turkey.
(b) She saw the house [that her father used to live in];
presentational relatives,Almost all of the children’s earliest relative clauses with
relativizers showed a very similar form called
presentational relatives 

The main clause is a presentational relative (usually a
predicate normal) that introduces a new topic / referent with
a proform such as this and here and a following copula
(a) This is the sugar that goes in there [Nina 3;0]
(b) Here’s a tiger that’s gonna scare him [Nina 3;1]
• The presentational relative (PR) is presented as new
information about the topic
• The PR may either have one topic (or referent) or two
• The PR does not have an embedded claus;
