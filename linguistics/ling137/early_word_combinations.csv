First words to first combinations,At around their first birthday, children start producing
first words
• First words are limited in meaning (but when they are
combined with gestures, they are more meaningful)
• At around 18 months old, children produce two-word
combinations with a pause between them (Bloom,
1973)
• Two-word combinations roughly describe state of
affairs and events;
pivot words,Some utterances are built around a small class of
pivot words,• The pivot word recurs in a constant position to
which can be attached:
want candy
want car
Juice gone
Milk gone ;
Positional patterns,
Utterances are known as originally pivot schemas or
positional patterns

They contain the formula of a constant-plus-variable, as
represented below
• The ‘X’ stands for an empty slot to be filled with a variable
from a large, open class of words
want candy
want car
Juice gone
Milk gone
Pivot + X
X + Pivot;
Some communicative
functions of positional patterns,
1. More + X: The child requests for more of
something. “Recurrence”
2. X + there: The child locates an entity or directs it
to a location. “Locative”
• Can we break down this positional pattern in
sub-patterns and identify more functions?
• X + on there, X + in there, X + down there
4. All + X: The child describes some property of an
entity or an event. “Referent description”
5. No + X: The child negates some state of affairs.
“Negation”
6. X + all gone, all gone + X, X + all done: The child
describes the disappearance of an entity.
“Disappearance";
What is missing from the early
word combinations?,Morphology;
Morphology,Inflectional morphemes have attracted most
attention from child language researchers
because children produce correct forms and
errors at the same time!;
Inflectional morphology ,• Learning inflectional morphology in any language is a
challenging task for children for two main reasons
1. Inflections can encode a range of possible
grammatical features in many languages
2. Different languages have different methods for
marking these features
• Theories of morphological development must account
for whatever errors children make with inflectional
morphology cross-linguistically;
One criterion for assessing mastery of a
grammatical morpheme, correct use in 90% of
obligatory contexts over three successive recording
sessions;
Mean length of utterance,How does one measure a child’s grammatical development —
specifically for morphemes — from spontaneous speech?
• Brown (1973) proposed using the mean length of utterance
(MLU)
• MLU is the average length of the utterances in a sample of
spontaneous speech and counted in terms of number of
morphemes (not words)
• One calculates the MLU by collecting at least 100 utterances
and dividing the number of morphemes by the number of
utterances: Total of morphemes / total of utterances;
Some criteria for identifying and counting morphemes,Irregular past tense verbs and irregular plurals count as one
morpheme (e.g. went, read, men, moose)
• Compound words, reduplications, and proper names count
as single morphemes (e.g. mailman, boom-boom, Big Bird)
• Diminuitives (e.g. doggie) and contracted words (e.g.
gonna) count as single morphemes
• But contracted auxiliary verbs, copulas, and possessive
markers count as distinct morphemes (e.g. she’s count
as two morphemes);
mlu example,1. Coconut is sleeping. (4 morphemes)
2. She jumped on the couch. (6 morphemes)
3. Mommy goed home. (4 morphemes)
4. That’s pretty. (3 morphemes)
5. Clouds are moving. (5 morphemes)
Total: 22 morphemes, 5 utterances
MLU: 22/5 = 4.4;
Overregularization,Prior to mastery of acquiring grammatical morphemes,
children make certain types of errors
• One well-documented error is assigning regular inflectional
markers to irregular words — overregularization
• go-ed instead of went
• falled instead of fell
• mouses instead of mice
• mooses instead of moose
• There is some variation in the rates of overregularizations
among English-speaking children!;
