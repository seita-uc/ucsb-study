Cognitive foundations, Developmental psychologist Michael Tomasello
argue that children arrive to the language acquisition
process with two general cognitive processes:
1. Intention-reading
2. Pattern-finding;
Pre-linguistic pointing,Around their first birthday, typically-developing
infants communicate by pointing before they can
produce language
• Extended index finger pointing in infants
• language-independent
• a likely universal act of human communication
Universal!!!
;
Liszkowski et al. (2012): Discussion,Other forms of pointing (lip- and chin-pointing) have not been
reported in infants, thus these forms may be learned later
through socialization
• Culture can shape infants’ usage of pointing later in
development;
Intention-reading,9-12 months of age: Infants develop an
understanding of the social world
• The self is not the only intentional agent
• Other persons as intentional agents with goals
and social means for attaining those goals
• They start reliably following the eye gaze of adults
and coordinating their interactions with them as well
as objects in the environments
• This leads to the establishment of joint attention
and common ground;
Joint attention,The child and their conversational partner share
or “join” their attention by attending to the same
object or event (through physical looking);
common ground,The sharing of information between the child and
the adult establishes common ground
• These cognitive foundations allow for the
opportunity for extending social interaction;
Cognitive and social
foundations,General cognitive processes of intention-reading
and pattern-finding
• Exposure to language!
• Not only do children need exposure to language,
they need it through social interaction;
Communicative exchanges,1. The participants establish joint attention, physical copresence, and conversational co-presence, and common
ground
2. The speaker understands what their listeners know and
tailor their utterances to accommodate them
3. The speaker uses appropriate speech acts for conveying
meaning
4. Participants listen to each other, signaling their
understanding, and take turns to contribute to conversation;
Child-directed speech,
When adults produce CDS, they:
• Modify their forms of their speech
• Modify the contents of their speech
• Scaffold the child’s contributions to conversation
• Expand the child’s utterances
• Offer new words
• Provide feedback
• Ask questions;
Modifying forms,• Phonological features
• Higher pitch
• Exaggerated intonation
• Slower rate of speaking
• Clearer enunciation of individual words;
Modifying forms + contents,Lexical and syntactic features
• Use of diminutives, e.g. doggie instead of dog
• High degree of repetition of words, e.g. there’s a
doggie, can you see the doggie?
• Use of simpler and shorter phrases;
Scaffolding,When children start taking turns with single-word
utterances, adults offer scaffolding, or framing to
support their turns by prompting them to respond:
• Example
Mother: Did you see Philip’s bird? Can you tell
Herb?
Child: Head. Head. Head.
Mother: What landed on your head?
Child: Bird.;
CDS in acquisition,What is the role and contribution of child-directed
speech in first language acquisition?
• Learning how to take turns and to participate in
face-to-face conversation in dyadic and polyadic
contexts
• Learning how to ask questions and answer them,
to make requests, to make jokes, in different
registers;
Cultural variation,Child-directed speech is not universal
• Cultural variation in child-rearing practices within and across speech
communities from ethnographic research
• Working-class African-American community in North Carolina:
Adults talk about babies, but not to them (Heath, 1983)
• Samoans: Infants are not regarded conversational partners until
they first produce a swear word, and then they are socialized to
use “good” and “bad” registers (Ochs, 1982)
• Kaluli in Papua New Guinea: Mothers speak for the child in a
special high nasal voice register and engage the child in
conversation by modeling how to speak for them (Schieffelin, 1979);
