Constructions,A construction is a learned pairing of form and function,
i.e. form with semantic or discourse function
• Constructions are not strictly predictable from their
component parts
• Constructions are assumed to represent patterns of
language usage in our everyday lives
• Constructions are assumed to be learnt on the basis of
input and general cognitive mechanisms;
Item-based constructions,At around their second birthday, children start
using syntactic marking, they produce item-based
constructions (also known as “verb-island”
constructions)

• Children use some verbs in one type of construction:
• Cut _____
• Throw _____
• Break _____
• _____ kick _____
• _____ running
• _____ fall down
• _____ give _____ _____

Children use some other verbs in a variety of
constructions:
• Draw _____
• Draw _____ on
• Draw _____ for _____
• _____ draw on _____;
Three challenges,
1. The poverty of the stimulus
2. The overgeneralization problem
3. The bootstrapping problem;
The poverty of stimulus,
Children don’t exactly imitate the language they hear (or
see) around them — otherwise we would not be able to
produce and understand novel constructions (see the
sneeze examples)
• The child’s environment is impoverished with sufficient
input for learning syntax rules of their native language
(Chomsky, 1957, 1971)
Thus learning syntax must be based on innate knowledge
known as universal grammar
• A set of innate linguistic categories, structures,
principles, and constraints that form the basis for the
grammars of all languages and account for first
language acquisition
• Universal grammar assumes that children only need
minimal input for acquiring language and becoming a
competent speaker,
The over-generalization problem,
How do children make appropriate generalizations about
language so that they can produce a potentially infinite
number of novel constructions based on a finite amount
of input?
• This is best illustrated in learning verbs:
*don’t giggle me (meaning, don’t make me giggle)
don’t tickle me
*I won you! (meaning, I won the game, I beat you, etc.)
I beat you!
• Different verbs have different argument structures
• Giggle v. tickle
• Win v. beat
• Children have to learn how to generate novel constructions
without overgeneralizing rules to all verbs
• Part of the over-generalization problem refers to the nonegative problem
• Children don’t always get direct negative evidence about
what’s grammatical and what’s not grammatical
