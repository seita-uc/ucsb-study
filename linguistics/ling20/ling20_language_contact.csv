Language contact,
• languages in contact may change
• how: depends on degree, nature and
length of contact.
– borrowing
– diglossia & code-switching
– creolization
– language areas;
Borrowing,
 phonological adaptation
– or, borrowing language gets new phoneme
• / ʒ / genre, rouge etc
• / v / very, vain
• (facilitated by other processes
– close / closure, explode / explosion
– life / lives, half / halves );
Loans
Lexical, grammatical, semantic borrowings
Pseduo-loans,
semantic shift
– chef, angst, chai
• pseudo-borrowing
– Handy, footing, furii dajaru, shampooing
• borrowing semantic extension
– Lakhota iŋjaŋk run;
Calques,
fußball, fernseher, fin-de-semaine;
Bilingualism
Multilingualism
Pidgin,
A linguistic system used when people with no
common languages are together in a situation
where they need to communicate.
– Uses pieces from the various languages of the
speakers.
– the language of the socially dominant group supplies
most of the vocabulary.
• Lexifier, superstratum
– often the result of colonialization.

• Non-inflectional
• Highly simplified grammars
• Reduced lexicons
• Not sensitive to social situations (no
registers)
• Relatively non-expressive
• Tendency for inter-speaker variation
• NO NATIVE SPEAKERS
;
Creole,
Develop from a pidgin
– sufficient population of pidgin-speaking
community
– “nativization”
• children acquire pidgin as first language
• The language expands & develops complexity
• Structurally complex
• Some morphology
• Full range of expressive power
• A natural language in all senses of that
term
;
Substratum, superstratum, lexifier
Convergence,
Over time, widespread diffusion means
language structures converge
– Languages become typologically similar
– extreme case: structural isomorphism
• grammar/semantics of two lgs is nearly identical;
Interference
Linguistic area,
Over time, widespread diffusion means
language structures converge
– Languages become typologically similar
– extreme case: structural isomorphism
• grammar/semantics of two lgs is nearly identical

Geographic regions characterized by:
– Multiple languages; multiple families
– share many linguistic features
• Diffusion:
– Spread of linguistic features among lgs
• unilateral/multilateral
• some examples:
– Balkans, India, SE Asia, Northern Asia;
Diffusion,
Spread of linguistic features among lgs
• unilateral/multilateral;
Code-switching,
• The use of different languages or dialects
by a single speaker at different times
• Situational code switching ( = diglossia )
– switch is dependent on social context
• Conversational code switching:
– switching back and forth in a single
conversation;
Bilingualism
Diglossia,language choice depends on formality;
