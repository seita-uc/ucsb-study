– [ t ][ ɛ ][ ʃ ][ z ] are sounds of English
– [ x ][ y ][ ɸ ][ c ] are not;
allophone,;

– represent the same phoneme;
contrastive distribution,
Sounds are different phonemes if:
– They occur in the same environment
• = surrounded by the same classes of speech
sounds
– and they may distinguish meaning

• [m, n, ŋ] voiced nasals
• [ɹ, l, w, j] voiced approximants
• [i, u] high, tense vowels
• [p, t, k] voiceless stops;
