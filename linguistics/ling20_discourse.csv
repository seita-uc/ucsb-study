3.Timing
4.Voice quality;
Types of prosodic functions,
• relative prominence within IU
– phrasal accents
• the most prominent part of an IU
• Typically louder, slower
• also *pitch change
• Terminal contours;
Substantive Unit, carry content ideas;
Regulatory Unit,– short, single word IUs
– regulate the flow of ideas
