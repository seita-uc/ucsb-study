Goals of historical linguistics,Determine
– language relationships
• do 2 languages share an ancestor?
– likely forms of proto-languages
• … and changes that have occurred since
• examine common changes cross-linguistically;
Proto-language,hypothesis about the form and structure of
a mother (ancestor) language
– reconstructed, hypothetical
– discovered via comparison
• identify languages that might be related
• assemble equivalent expressions
• Look for consistent patterns;
cognate,
words suspected to be related in different languages
– similar phonological form, similar meaning
Evidence of language relationship
– Larger number of cognates → higher
likelihood of relationship
– Inference:
• have developed independently from a single
source
;
sound change,;
mother language, daughter language;
borrowing,
Some similarities occur because of contact
– Eg, sushi in English and Japanese
– word is shared because of borrowing of
cultural concept
– not cognates;
assimilation,;
palatalization,;
family tree,
• misses internal variation of languages.
• misses contact between languages.
• makes language change seem sudden.;
comparative method,
Detects regular sound correspondences
– Systematic differences or similarities in the
segment inventories of two languages
– seen in recurrent patterns of cognates
• Enables reconstruction of proto-languages;
wave model,
Wave theory model was developed to
supplement the family tree model.
– Language areas, sprachbund;
sound correspondence,;
deletion,;
innovation,;
diachronic,;
devoicing,;
Grimm’s law,• Germanic languages:
– *p, t, k → f, θ, h
• other European languages:
– *p, t, k → p, t, k
– Grk, Lat, etc. : voiceless stops :: Eng, G : fricatives;
synchronic,;
voicing,;
proto-form,;
morpho-syntactic,;
typology,
– groups languages by structural properties,
regardless of familial relationship
– e.g., morphosyntactic or phonological
typology;
